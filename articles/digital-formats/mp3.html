MP3 (formally or extensively referred to as MPEG-1 Layer III Encoding, or MPEG-2 Layer III Encoding) is a digital lossy audio format, which uses psychoacoustic models to discard frequencies (found in the format's structure) not perceptible to the human ear, to ensure the audio is stored concisely.

The format comes with quality loss, where precisely preserving the original soundwaves is less of a concern.
