<p>This article has been written as an oversimplified summary of the MP3 format. If seeking for more information, another source is the best way to go.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
MP3 (formally referred to as MPEG-1 Layer III Encoding) is a digital lossy audio format, which uses psychoacoustic models to discard frequencies not perceptible to the human ear, to ensure the audio is stored concisely. The format comes with quality loss, where file sizes are a priority, and preserving the original quality is not a concern.
<h2>Is It Patented?</h2>
Historically, the MP3 format was designed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (commonly known as MPEG), and historically patented by <a href="https://technicolor.com" target="_blank">Technicolor</a>, a company which specializes in filmmaking and technologies. The last license (relating to the MP3 structure) expired on April 27th, 2017. So, no, it is no longer patented, and you are free to write an MP3 audio encoder/decoder without worrying about legal issues.
