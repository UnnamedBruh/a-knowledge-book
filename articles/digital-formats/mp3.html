<h2>Overview</h2>
MP3 (formally or extensively referred to as MPEG-1 Layer III Encoding, or MPEG-2 Layer III Encoding) is a digital lossy audio format, which uses psychoacoustic models to discard frequencies (found in the format's structure) not perceptible to the human ear, to ensure the audio is stored concisely.

The format comes with quality loss, where precisely preserving the original soundwaves is less of a concern.
<h2>Is It Patented?</h2>
Historically, the MP3 format was designed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (commonly known as MPEG), and used to be patented by Technicolor (which specializes in filmmaking), until the format's license expired on April 27th, 2017. So no, it is no longer protected, and you are free to write an MP3 audio encoder/decoder.
