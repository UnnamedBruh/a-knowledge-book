<a>In the U.S., you must be <b>21 years of age or older</b> to legally possess any alcoholic beverage. This law is governed by the <b>National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984</b>, with the exception of allowing possession for religious purpose, only if accompanied by a guardian or parent. This law ensures the protection of safety and health among younger people, by reducing vehicle crashes and underage drinking. Any state was granted the freedom to vary their enforcement at that time (e.g. children could drink for religion without supervision, children could not drink at all).</a><br><br>
