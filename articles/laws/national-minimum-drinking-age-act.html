<p>In the U.S., the act generally states <b>all citizens must be 21 years of age or older</b> to legally possess any alcoholic beverage. This law is governed by the <b>National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984</b>, allowing any exception or variance of how this act is enforced (for each state). This law ensures the protection of safety and health among younger people, by reducing vehicle crashes and underage drinking.</p>
