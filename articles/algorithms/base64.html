<h1>Simplified Overview</h1>
<p>Base64 is a text-safe encoding scheme. It uses <b>64 characters</b> for encoding, and one for padding. Padding is important for truncating sizes of encoded text while maintaining accuracy. Each encoded character represents 6 bits, so encoded text uses about 33% more data.</p>
<p>Base64 is used for storing images in HTML and CSS documents. However, proper compression, or omitting Base64-encoding (if your text uses ASCII), is necessary if overhead is a concern.</p>
<h1>Low-Level Mappings</h1>
<p>Each Base64 character maps to a specific value (A-Z -> 0-25, a-z -> 26-51, 0-9 -> 52-61, + -> 62, / -> 63). Here is the table below.</p>
